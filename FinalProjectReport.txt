Final Project Report

	The project went little smoother than expected in some aspects and more 
difficult in other areas. The physics, which was the main focus of the game, 
turned out to go alot easier than expected. As we kept implamenting features 
and mechanics, the physics was the great wall we had to get over each time but 
never took longer than 1 sit-down session. Another aspect that went really well 
was audio. None of us had experience in loading in and playing audio to a game 
engine, but after the first or second iteration of audio, the background music 
and some sound effects were in. The user interface from SDKTrays became one of 
the more frustrating issues to deal with. This resulted in us scoping back to 
a simpler implamentation of hit force. Getting in user input with OIS and 
using the StateMachine implamentation for game and player states was a smaller 
success we came across.
	Some bugs still exist in the game, one of which is where while using
high hit strength, the player can hit the ball out of the playing field through
the walls. Another issue we had is constant sound effect noise when a ball is 
close to a wall enough to touch the wall. The sound would play over and over 
again albeit not explicitly bouncing against the wall.
